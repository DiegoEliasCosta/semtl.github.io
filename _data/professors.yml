  bio: My main goal is to provide tools and techniques for software engineers and experts in other science and engineering disciplines that improve their productivity and help them output artifacts of high quality. My main research interests fall in software design based on the model-driven engineering approach. In particular, I am interested in model transformation and collaborative modeling. I also work on simulation-based design, code generation, and deployment of large applications.

  bio: I work to create formal but practical techniques and methods for engineering software. To do this, I draw from disciplines such as formal verification, model-based engineering, and empirical methods. I study the context of software development and create novel techniques that use domain-specific abstractions that are supported by rigorous automation.

  bio: I am a Full Professor of Computer and Software Engineering in ECE at Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, Concordia University. My research focuses on the opportunities at the intersection of Software Engineering and Data Analytics. I am particularly interested in approaches that harness the wealth of information in software traces and logs, process logs, code commits, etc. to support software development and operations, software evolution and analytics, anomaly detection, and operational intelligence tasks. My research has an industrial focus. Over the years, I have led many research and development projects with various organizations including Ericsson, CAE, Ubisoft, Marivent, Opal-RT, and DRDC (Defence R&D Canada).  I am fortunate to work with a great team of talented students and professionals. Together, we evaluate and apply techniques from Software Development and Modeling, Big Data Analytics, and Machine and Deep Learning. Several of our original tools (e.g., CommitAssistant and TotalADS) have been successfully transferred to our collaborators from industry and government and are used by a large number of developers.
