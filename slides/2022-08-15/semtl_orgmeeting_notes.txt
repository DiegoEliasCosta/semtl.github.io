- Community, Collaboration, Competition
 - Software engineering most likely regroups the largest number of researchers in Montreal, but it lacks organization.
 - The importance of the SE group of Montreal is probably more known ... outside Montreal
 - FQRT / regroupement stratÃ©gique? -> objective for the next year?
 - Chicken-and-egg problem: we need to have a group organized enough to have the support from the universities, need the support from the universities to manage to organize the group more formally
 - If we manage to regroup info about 50 SE profs from Montreal and their publications, this could show to the universities why it is important to support the creation of a SE group in Montreal
 - Probably needs a senior researcher dedicated to developing such organization?

. Schedule
 - Two meetings per term (to be more flexible on the dates), with the two hosting groups selected in advance.
 - Maybe one bigger event per year? (one full day for instance)

. Format
 - One keynote + Two technical talks?
 - Posters (when time allows, for bigger meetings?)
 - Idea: researchers could register with their talk info and other members could vote for the talks they want to hear
   - Through website?

. Organisation
 - steering committee
 - org committee (students and postdocs. To update the website, coordinate information, maybe organise the one-year event?)

. Industry:
 - truly engaging with industry is difficult
 - IVADO and SEMLA are already doing that
 - SE@MTL covers a lot of topics. If at some points we realize we have cluster on some keywords, we can then target industries with specific topics.
 - We could build a catalog of expertise for e.g., consulting, industry.
